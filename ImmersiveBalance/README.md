# ImmersiveBalance

ImmersiveBalance is a mod that is using Redscript to work<br><br>

In 2.0 CDPR introduced categories set for primary stats(still limited to 20)<br>
with completely redoing perk system to roughly 45 perks per stat<br>
and limiting max stat gain to 66 while max perks to <br>
While total required for stats is: 100 and perks is: 221<br>
There is a website to check how it works: https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/build-planner<br>
Main idea: level stats based on exp gained for proficiency in weapon category<br>
meaning you get +X to stat relative to category of weapon you used to level up<br>
and it would give perks to level your entire tree<br>
which has to be related to same categories CDPR did:<br>
0-3 you got nothing, total noob and player starts there.<br>
4-8 got some skill<br>
8-14 pro<br>
15-20 legend<br><br>

Easiest way to do it is to attach Stat Points(SP) to levels in new Skill Progression System<br>
And most balanced approach is to set attributes to 0 and go from there with hard being the setting<br>
meaning we get 1 AP for each 3 levels in Skill Progression.<br>
